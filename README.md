Caleb
* Recent code changes have introduced a host of problems for serialization. At the moment, the serialization mechanism cannot save all of the game objects. However, it successfully saves and loads files with the unit tests.

·The shoot implement didn't implement the model-view requirement yet. I creat the observer but didn't use it now.
·ConcurrentModificationException (The basic functions are not affected)
·Enemy can attact when the first time to click play from the main window to game window, but they can make damage to the stronghold if I use the same main window, close the game window and open the game window again.
·I cannot press the screen to use my bullet, on the the way, the missed shoot will not be counted.
