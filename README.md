* The shoot implement didn't implement the model-view requirement yet. I creat the observer but didn't use it now.
* ConcurrentModificationException (The basic functions are not affected)
* Enemy can attact when the first time to click play from the main window to game window, but they can make damage to the stronghold if I use the same main window, close the game window and open the game window again.
* I cannot press the screen to use my bullet, on the the way, the missed shoot will not be counted.
