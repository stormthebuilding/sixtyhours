## Known Issues
Caleb
* After loading a saved game, the enemies move at an increased speed. When one enemy is damaged, the speed of the other enemies return to normal.          
* After loading a saved game in which some of the enemies are at the stronghold, enemy elimination becomes very inconsistent. When one enemy is clicked on, a different one appears to get damaged instead. On some occasions not all of the enemies can be eliminated after loading.
