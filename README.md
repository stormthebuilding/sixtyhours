# Storm the Stronghold (Alpha)
## Instructions
When the title page appears, click the "Play" button to start the game. At this stage of the game, you must click on the "Spawn Enemy" button to make the enemy appear. You can then click on the enemy to shoot at them. If the enemy gets to the stronghold, they can damage it. Once you have fired all of the shots in your clip, you must click the "Reload" button to fill your clip back up with shots.

## Known Issues
Caleb
* Recent code changes have introduced a host of problems for serialization. At the moment, the serialization mechanism cannot save all of the game objects. However, it works as intended when used with unit tests.    

Kevin

Nick

* Apply the reload to different weapons
* Menu window
* Give a delay to reload
* Enemy can attact when the first time to click play from the main window to game window, but they can make damage to the stronghold if I use the same main window, close the game window and open the game window again.
* I cannot press the screen (the other place beside the enemy) to use my bullet, on the the way, the missed shoot will not be counted.

Reshi

* No known issues
